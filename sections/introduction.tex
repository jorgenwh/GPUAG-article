\section*{Introduction}

Genotyping is a prominent application of the massive amounts of data provided by high-throughput sequencing. 
Recent developments in graph and alignment-free methods of genotyping have resulted in genotyping methods yielding competitive accuracies with significantly reduced time costs.
Some state-of-the-art genotypers of this kind perform most of their process in the form of array-operations. This has naturally led to array-libraries such as NumPy to be utilized for performant implementations.
