\section*{Results}

Together, the three implementations described above have been incorporated into KAGE, resulting in GKAGE (GPU KAGE), yielding up to ... speedup over KAGE running on a ... CPU with ... cores, when running on a ... GPU.

This work has further resulted in partial GPU support of BioNumPy, as well as two Python packages: \textit{CuCounter}, found at \url{https://github.com/jorgenwh/cucounter}, providing an easy to use static GPU hash table, and \textit{CuStats}, found at \url{https://github.com/jorgenwh/custats}, providing the log of the probabiliy mass function with GPU support in Python.
