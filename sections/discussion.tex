\section*{Discussion}
While adding GPU support to KAGE have resulted in the potential for significant speedup for users with a Nvidia GPU, the current implementations come with a couple of caveats.
Both the CuCounter and CuStats packages are only supported by Nvidia GPUs.
Furthermore, the goal of this work has not been to improve upon or compete with state-of-the-art implementations for the respective processes implemented here, but rather to provide easy-to-use Python implementations that could be used in KAGE to speed up state-of-the-art graph-based and alignment-free genotyping in Python for users having access to a Nvidia GPU.

Further work may naturally lie in implementing support for GPUs created by other manufacturers, as well as exploring more sophisticated static GPU hash table schemes.
