\begin{abstract}

Genotyping is a prominent application of high-throughput sequencing data. 
Recent graph-based and alignment-free genotyping methods allow for much of the compute performed in the genotyping process to be array-based.
Some state-of-the-art graph and alignment-free based genotypers use array-libraries such as NumPy \cite{numpy} to create performant solutions in Python. 
However, few options are available allowing for fast GPU accelerated genotyping in Python.
Here I present a set of Python packages providing GPU accelerated functionality for graph and alignment-free genotyping, achieving up to one and two orders of magnitude speedup compared to corresponding NumPy solutions.
