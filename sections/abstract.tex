\begin{abstract}

Genotyping is a prominent application of high-throughput sequencing data. 
Recent graph-based and alignment-free genotyping methods allow for much of the compute performed in the genotyping process to be array-based.
Some state-of-the-art graph and alignment-free based genotypers use array-libraries such as NumPy \cite{numpy} to create performant solutions in Python. 
However, few options are available allowing for fast GPU accelerated genotyping in Python.
We have taken a basis in the current state-of-the-art graph-based and alignment-free genotyper KAGE \cite{kage} and developed a GPU supported version called GKAGE.
I also show that GKAGE, running on a GPU, achieves up to ... speed up over KAGE, running on a CPU.
